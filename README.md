Background
---------------
---------------
The United States Geological Survey (USGS), is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. They manage large datasets and need ways to visualize them that are easily understood and accessible to the general public.

Build a new set of tools that will allow the USGS to visualize their earthquake data. 


### Objective ###

Visualize the earthquake dataset in an interactive way.

Retrieve the data for all earthquakes for the last 7 days from [The USGS geoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php), import and visualize the data through:
- Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. With data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
    - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.
- Popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
- A legend that provides context for the map data.
